    <h4 id="d1">Career Objective</h4>
    <p>A Career Objective or a Resume Objective is essentially a heading statement that describes your
        professional goals in two to three sentences. Employers looking to hire an employee for a position tend
        to seek candidates that are driven enough to understand what they want.</p>
